SOUNDS HAVE BEEN RECORDED FROM THE THE HEALTHY AND NON HEALTHY MOTORS AT NO LOAD AND HALF LOAD CONDITIONS.

THOSE SOUNDS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED BY APPLYING SOME FILTERS AND FEATURES LIKE MEAN , VARIANCE , KURTOSIS WERE EXTRACTED.

THE EXTRACTED FEATURES ARE FORMATTED TO A CSV FILE TO MAKE A NEW CLEAN DATA SET

ML MODELS LIKE LOGISTIC REGRESSION , DECISION TREE , SVM  WERE EMPLOYED AND THE BEST MODEL HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.

A USABLE GRADIO WEBSITE HAS BEEN CREATED AND THE ML MODEL HAS BEEN DEPLOYED TO IT.

SO THE OUTPUT THAT ENSURES WHEATHER THE MACHINE IS IN FAULT CONDIION OR IN AN HEALTHY CONDITION DEPENDS ON THE INPUTS WHICH HAS BEEN EXTRACTED IN THE SOUND PROCESSING.
